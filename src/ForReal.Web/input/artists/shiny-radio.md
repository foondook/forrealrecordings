In 2009, the Shiny Radio alias was founded by Ilya Shiny, His first album "Грациозно" (Gracefully) was recorded with influences from different performers such as Tricky, Gorillaz, Morcheeba, DJ Krush, Aim and Bonobo. Working with a noted focus on a combination of hip-hop, downtempo and trip-hop coupled with scratching. After 4 of these releases, he diceded to switch up the project's intended sound. In 2013, his 'Feel The Fire' EP was released by Dutch label Celsius Recordings. The release fot wholly positive reviews and a good reception from both international and Russian listeners. The EP was recorded with the involvement of singer La Kos, who is now a constant participant of the project.

After releases on Silent Audio and Soul Deep Recordings, early 2016 saw Ilya's first release on Soulvent with Panda's Anthem & Hug (SV019), but there are surely more to follow! We're huge fans of Shiny's feel-good style of production, bathed in nostalgia and good vibes and he makes a welcome addition to our ever growing roster of international artists!
